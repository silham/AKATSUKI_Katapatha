/**
 * Owner: BE3
 *
 * The stop-event applier. Every driver transition (ARRIVED, UNLOAD_START,
 * DELIVERED, PART_DELIVERED, FAILED, POD_CAPTURED) rides this one
 * endpoint, which is also what the sync batch endpoint drains to — same
 * applier, online or outbox, so the two paths cannot diverge.
 *
 * Idempotency: every incoming event carries a client-minted ULID. If
 * that id is already in StopEvent, we count it as a duplicate without
 * re-applying. The underlying services also no-op if the stop is
 * already past the state the event would advance it to, so a replay
 * from a flaky driver phone is always safe.
 *
 * Conflicts: a stop can move to another vehicle, or be delivered by one,
 * between the moment the device recorded a fact and the moment it reaches
 * here. Such an event is recorded with its `ConflictState` and NOT applied —
 * see services/conflicts.ts for why that is neither an acceptance nor an
 * error.
