/**
 * A delivery photo, as a JPEG data URL.
 *
 * expo-image-picker's camera rather than expo-camera: the OS camera UI removes a
 * viewfinder screen, a preview-and-retake flow and a permissions edge case, none
 * of which is this product.
 *
 * The resize is not optional. A raw 12MP capture is 1-2 MB of base64, which would
 * travel in a JSON body and sit in SQLite until the batch drained. At 1280px wide
 * and quality 0.5 the same photo is 120-250 KB and still clearly shows a pallet,
 * a door or a damaged carton -- which is what the photo is for.
