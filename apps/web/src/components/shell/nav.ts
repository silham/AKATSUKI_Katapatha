/**
 * What each role's rail contains.
 *
 * This is navigation *content*, not a route registry: the App Router still
 * discovers pages from the filesystem, and a page that is not listed here still
 * works. CONVENTIONS.md rule 2 forbids a central list everyone appends to —
 * this is one file describing one menu per role, which is what the designs
 * specify (D-02 shows seven items for the dispatcher, L-02 three for the
 * loader, S-02 five for the store).
 *
 * `match` is a regex because a section stays current while you are inside it:
 * /loader/trips/{id} is still "Dock", and /store/orders/{id} is still
 * "My orders". Carried over from the per-role sidebars this replaced.
 *
 * `scope` — the line under the role name in the chip — is the most load-bearing
 * string in the shell. A dispatcher is scoped to one depot, a loader to one
 * dock, a store manager to one outlet, and every authorization predicate in the
 * API enforces exactly that. Showing it constantly is how the operator knows
 * which records they are about to act on.
