/**
 * The Katapatha palette, as data.
 *
 * Values come from DESIGN.md, which is the binding design system. The previous
 * repository carried TWO divergent token sets that disagreed on the brand
 * colours (Style was ruby #AE0109 in the working application and purple
 * #9333EA in the design prototype). DESIGN.md settles it; this file is now the
 * single source and is LEAD-owned.
 *
 * React Native cannot read CSS custom properties, so the mobile app imports
 * these values and the web imports tokens.css. Both are generated from the same
 * table here — keep them in step.
